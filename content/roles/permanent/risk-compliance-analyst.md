### What You Can Expect

Reporting into the Head of Risk and Compliance, the aim of the role is to provide support for all Information Security projects, assurance, processes and objectives of the Risk and Compliance (R&C) team.

- Your primary focus will be to be an active participant of R&C team, and to continuously learn, create and improve our processes and methodology. It is our responsibility to partner with the rest of the Group to ensure everyone is speaking the same language in Group Security, Tech departments and the wider group, and you will take a big role in promoting risk and compliance information as needed.
- You will be a part of the team who respond to various regulatory/audit requirements, so being aware of PCI and GDPR requirements and working with various other stakeholders (Tech, Privacy, Legal, HR, etc) is a big asset. There will be lots of opportunity for you to further expand your knowledge relating to regulatory requirements.
- The R&C team works closely with all teams in Group Security, Tech and the business. Understanding what they do and how they do it is very important to enable us to tell an accurate risk story. Although you don't need to be a technical expert, having the ability to understand both sides of the business really helps in getting the right answer.
- Part of our responsibility includes Vendor Risk Management. We enable the business to understand the risk of various relationships and make informed decisions regarding who they work with. You will be in charge of reviewing these responses and creating risk reports as a result.
- Using Jira and Confluence, and exploring the ways information and data can be used to tell fact-based risk stories, is an area we explore and expand on daily. You will be the ‘go-to’ person for running risk reports using these systems, and we will ensure you get the training you need to do this.
- Creating and updating Policy, in line with the changing threat landscape and compliance requirements helps you understand various industry standards that make up these documents, and translating them into relevant requirements. You will own the schedule for these updates, and to ensure review meetings are run as per the defined process.
- Group Security work together as one team, so when someone else on the team needs us as a matter of priority, we provide the support they need. Not only does this help move the team forward together, it also provides exposure to various parts of the team which are not your primary area of responsibility (such as Cloud Security, Application Security, Incident response, Training and awareness, etc).
- This is an opportunity for you to become an expert in risk and compliance, as well as security disciplines, through your cross function support work.
