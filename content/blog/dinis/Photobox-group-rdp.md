### Our commitment to you 
 
We will review all submissions and provide timely and clear responses on validation.
  
Please note that this is not a bug bounty program, but we will recognise the efforts of those researchers who help us improve our security controls when we see fit. 

The prioritization and rating of a submission will be based upon a number of factors including, but not limited to, the Bugcrowd Vulnerability Rating Taxonomy and the business impact of the vulnerability reported.  |
